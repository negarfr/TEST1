       What is the difference between "primitive" and "non-primitive" data types?
       1)primitive data types contain just values, non-primitive data types contain value+method
       2)primitive data types names use just lowercase characters, but non-primitive data type names use uppercase at the beginning
       3)primitive data types were created by java, developers can not create primitive data types.
       But non-primitive data types can be created by Java and by any developer
       4)non-primitive data types use same size area in memory but primitive data types use different size area in memory.
